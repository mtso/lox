# typescript implementation

typescript implementation expects the [Deno](https://github.com/denoland/deno)
runtime, which you can install with:

```
curl -fsSL https://deno.land/x/install/install.sh | sh
```

# extensions to base lox

- [v] dynamic property access
- [ ] anonymous functions
- [ ] exceptions // maybe not needed with class Result(ok, value)
- [-] builtins: strlen, substr, readfile, stdout
- [ ] improved print? (make builtin rather than stmt)
